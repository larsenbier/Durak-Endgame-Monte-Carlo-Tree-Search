# Durak-Endgame-Monte-Carlo-Tree-Search

The Durak Engame Monte Carlo Tree Search (Durak MCTS) repository contains a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) based AI for playing Durak, implemented in Python.

The code provided can be run through `main.py` to play against the AI yourself. The paramters of the AI can be directly modified in the source code to alter the runtime for performance.

Here, we use the rules for the popular variant of Durak known as "Perevodnoy Durak" (Transfer Durak). More information on the rules can be found (here)[https://www.pagat.com/beating/perevodnoy_durak.html]
